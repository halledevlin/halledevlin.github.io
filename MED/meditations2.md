Meditations on the Bible
=========================

My writer's brain communicates best with God through putting words down on paper, and these meditations are the result.  They are my replies to God upon reading His "messages" to me.  I invite you to listen in on the conversation.  Perhaps my conversation with God can inspire one of your own.

The following notes are important to getting the most out of these meditations:

-   I urge you to read the subject passage first. If you don't have a Bible handy, I recommend
    [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com) - a very useful and easy-to-use on-line Bible, with
    many different translations available.  Another on-line bible resource is [Bible Study Tools](http://www.biblestudytools.com), which also offers various commentaries and other tools for deeper study.
-   I read various translations as I write these. The translation(s)
    quoted in a particular meditation are noted, either in the text or under
    the title.
