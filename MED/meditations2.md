Meditations on the Bible
=========================

My writer's brain communicates best by putting words on paper.  Thus, the best way I've found to communicate with God is to write about His writings.  These meditations are the result -- my replies to God on reading His "messages" to me.  I invite you to listen in on the conversation.  Perhaps my conversations with God can inspire one of your own.

The following notes are important to getting the most out of these meditations:

-   I urge you to read the bible passage first. If you don't have a Bible handy, I recommend
    [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com) - a very useful and easy to use online Bible resource, with
    many translations available.  Another online resource is [Bible Study Tools](http://www.biblestudytools.com), which also offers various commentaries and other tools for deeper study.
-   I read, and quote, various translations as I write these. The translation(s)
    quoted in a particular meditation are noted, either in the text or under
    the title.
