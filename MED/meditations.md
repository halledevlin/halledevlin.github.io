Meditations on the Bible
=========================

These short pieces are my reactions upon reading various bible passages. My writer's brain
communicates best with God through putting words down on paper, and these meditations are the result. 
They are written not so much to communicate to other people as to express my thoughts to God.  I invite you to listen in on the conversation.  Perhaps my conversation with God can inspire one of your own.

The following notes are important to getting the most out of these meditations:

-   I urge you to read the passage first. If you don't have a bible handy, I recommend
    [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com) - a very useful and easy-to-use online bible, with
    many different translations available.  Other on-line bible resources include [Bible Study Tools](http://www.biblestudytools.com) (others?)
-   I read various translations before writing these. The translation(s)
    quoted in a particular "meditation" are noted, either in the text or under
    the title.

[Meditation on John 4:  The Woman at the Well](MED/john_4.md)
[Meditation on II Kings 22 - 23:  King Josiah](MED/kings_22.md)
[Meditation on Hebrews 8:  Writing on My Heart](MED/hebrews_8.md)
