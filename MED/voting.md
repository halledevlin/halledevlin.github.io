title: Voting as Worship

> This is my prayer: that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight. I pray this so that you will be able to decide what really matters and so you will be sincere and blameless on the day of Christ.  --[Philippians 1:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phillipians+1&version=CEB) (CEB)

I want to worship God with all that I am.  Does that "all that I am" include how
I vote?  And, how do I
"worship" with my vote in an election like this one? 

Today I felt like I came upon the answer, here in Philippians
1: "that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and
all kinds of insight."  If we are
going to bring Jesus' love to the world, how can we ignore the power we have to
do that through our votes?  But, to bring
His love, we first have to fill ourselves with *knowledge* and *insight*.  

But how can I find that knowledge and insight, when everyone
seems to be lying through their teeth? 

First, I have to remind myself that there are God-lovers on
all sides.  It's easy to believe that the
other side comes from the devil.  I find
myself doing that all the time.   But I
have friends and family on all sides. 
There must be something good, something worth listening to, to have
attracted them. 

How do I, then, find those things worth listening to?  

I have to *seek*
them.  To look for not just what is easy
to see, but what *God* wants me to
see.  That means looking prayerfully at *all* sources of information, even those
that make me feel uncomfortable because they don't agree with me.  I have to recognize that what candidates and
their supporters say--especially about the opposing candidate--can't always be
trusted.  Spin-doctoring is
everywhere.  I need to use what I hear as
a springboard for my own research, to sources that are less likely to be
biased, such as non-partisan institutions. (I link to some sites like this at
the end of this post.)

The internet has made fact-checking easier, but it’s still
hard work.  Yet, if my vote is an
offering to God, it should be the best offering I can give.  I need to pray for God to teach me, and give
me the stamina to see it through, and the courage to learn and let my mind
change if the evidence says it should.

> "Most important, live together in a manner worthy of
Christ’s gospel...." --Philippians 1:27 (CEB)

Secondly, to make my vote a form of worship I have to make my
vote match God's desires.  Not what will
make me comfortable.  Not what the people
around me think.  I have to put myself in
God's place, try to see with His eyes, and care about the world and all of its
people the way He does.  Even the people
I don't like, can't understand, or who are against me.  

Lastly, I have to *trust*.  Trust that He will open my eyes.  Trust that, even if He calls me in a
direction that seems certain to ruin everything, He will take care of me.

The world groans in its bondage to Satan.  Please join me in whole-heartedly searching
for God's answer, God's vote, for this election.  I believe that we can use these little bits
of power to ease the world out of its chains and a little closer to God's
love.  The God who made every single
inhabitant of this world, and loves each one as His own child.  The God who loves even the bloodthirsty
terrorist, even the unwanted child, and yes, even the arrogant politician.

> "Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." --Philippians 2:1-4 (NIV)
