title: Voting as Worship

> This is my prayer: that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight. I pray this so that you will be able to decide what really matters and so you will be sincere and blameless on the day of Christ.  --[Philippians 1:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phillipians+1&version=CEB) (CEB)

One of my favorite songs has a line that says, 

    "Let every breath, all that I am
    Never cease to worship You."

Does worshiping God with "all that I am" include voting?  And, how do I "worship" with my vote in an election like this one? 

Today I felt like I came upon the answer, here in Philippians 1: "that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight."  If we are going to bring Jesus' love to the world, how can we ignore the power we have to do that through our votes?  But, to bring His love, we first have to fill ourselves with *knowledge* and *insight*.  

But how can I find that knowledge and insight, when everyone seems to be lying through their teeth? 

First, I have to remind myself that there are God-lovers on all sides.  It's easy to believe that the other side comes from the devil.  I find myself doing that all the time.   But I have friends and family on all sides.  There must be something good, something worth listening to, to have attracted them. 

How do I, then, find those things worth listening to?  

I have to *seek* them.  To look for not just what is easy to see, but what God wants me to see.  That means looking prayerfully at all sources of information, even those that make me feel uncomfortable because they don't agree with me.  I have to find sources that are less likely to be biased, such as non-partisan institutions.  I have to recognize that what candidates and their supporters say can't always be trusted.  Spin-doctoring is everywhere, and what both “sides” say must be neither dismissed nor swallowed whole, but used as a springboard to research outside either party’s bubble. 

The internet has made fact-checking easier, but it’s still hard work.  Yet, if my vote is an offering to God, it should be the best offering I can give.  I need to pray for God to teach me, and give me the stamina to see it through, and the courage to learn and let my mind be changed.

> Most important, live together in a manner worthy of Christ’s gospel...." --Philippians 1:27 (CEB)

Secondly, to make my vote a form of worship I have to see how every proposal, every platform, every element of character, matches God's desires.  Not what will make me comfortable.  Not what my family or neighbors or coworkers or the people in my church think.  I have to put myself in God's place, try to see with His eyes, and care about the world and all of its people the way He does.  

Lastly, I have to *trust*.  Trust that He will open my eyes.  I have to trust that, even if He calls me in a direction that seems certain to ruin everything, He will take care of me.

The world groans in its bondage to Satan.  Please join me in whole-heartedly searching for God's answer, God's vote, for this election.  I believe that we can, with our one vote each, use this little bit of power to ease the world out of its chains and a little closer to God's love.  The God who made every single inhabitant of this world, and loves each one as His own child.  The God who loves even the bloodthirsty terrorist, even the unwanted child, and yes, even the arrogant politician.

> "Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." --Philippians 2:1-4 (NIV)
