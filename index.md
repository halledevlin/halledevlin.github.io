============================


What to write, what to write?  

Do I satisfy my physics-loving technical side with a wild, throughly-calculated romp among the stars and beyond?  Or dive deep into my horse's liquid eyes, and reach beyond both them and me?  Or indulge in the sweet, indescribable joy of communion with the Almighty?  

Hmm.  

*Why not try all three?*

## [God is a Horseman: About Horses and Horsemen, and Horsemen and God](giah.html)

*God is a Horseman* is an inspirational picture book about the unique relationship between horse and horseman.  And, it is an introduction to how that exquisite bond mirrors our own bond with God.

Excerpt:
> Curly is looking at me.  His thick, gracefully curving neck is drawn up over his well-muscled russet shoulders.  His bountiful black mane froths downward in wild, matted locks behind his chiseled head, and his bright white star is half-hidden by the forelock draped over his eyes.   He's facing me, broad chest pointed right at me as if ready to run me down, his large, liquid eyes trained on me intently.  I'm pretty sure he's wondering why I've put him in this fenced paddock, separate from all the other horses, and what I'm going to do to him....


[Looking for Adventure](LFA.md)
-----------------------

A rock-hard sci-fi adventure to a far-off rock... and then some.

Excerpt:
> *_Looking for adventure?  Calamatite.  Furthest asteroid from the Sun.  Pilot and engineer needed.  Send resume to Bill Shields, Albert Leigh, Texas._*
>
>Lieutenant Julian Hager turned his attention back to the ammonia pump, which was finally done venting.  Loosing a breath, he started a staccato, magnetic-clamping lumber over the ship's fuselage to shut the valve.  Once it was shut, he paused to pan his gaze around, taking in the view one last time before hopping over into his ship's open airlock.  Earth.  The blazing sun.  All pasted up against black depths of empty vacuum beyond.  All looking pretty much motionless as he and the ships all glided silently, effortlessly, and ever-so-uneventfully toward Earth.
>
>*Boring.*
>
>But prospecting on a distant asteroid--that wouldn't be boring.  
>
>*Calamatite.*  
>
>*Money.*  
>
>After living four years on a lowly lieutenant's pay, Julian was hungry, and for more than just excitement.  The ad's timing couldn't have have been better.
