Miss Harter's Toad is the endearing true story of how a stow-away toad changed everything in the 3rd-grade classroom of one Miss Harter.  Whimsically illustrated, this tale was written for 2nd and 3rd grade readers or to be read to children of any age.   It is a completely local and small-business product, as the author, illustrator, and publisher all call the Dayton, Ohio area home.  We expect it to be available online and in Dayton-area bookstores in early 2017.  Check back here for links!
