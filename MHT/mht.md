Miss Harter's Toad is the endearing true story of how a stow-away toad changed everything in the 3rd-grade classroom of one Miss Harter.  It was written for 2nd and 3rd grade readers, or to be read to children of any age.  Whimsically illustrated, this tale is set in Dayton, Ohio, where author, illustrator, and publisher all reside.  We expect it to be available online and in local Dayton bookstores in early 2017.
