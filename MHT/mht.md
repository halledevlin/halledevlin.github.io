Miss Harter's Toad is the endearing true story of how a stowaway toad changed everything in the 3rd-grade classroom of one Miss Harter.  This whimsical illustrated tale is perfect for 2nd and 3rd grade readers, or to be read to children of any age.   It is a completely local product - the author, illustrator, and publisher all call the Dayton, Ohio area home.  We expect it to be available online and in Dayton-area bookstores in early 2017.  Check back here for links!

And to give credit where credit is due, the lovely illustrations on this page as well as in the book were drawn by Tyler Mackey, working with [Mr. Fox Studios](www.mrfoxstudios.com).
