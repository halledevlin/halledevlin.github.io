\#1:  A One-Eyed Horse
======================

Last weekend, I moved a horse for a friend, from my neighbor's farm to one just a few roads over. The horse's name was Mingo, a big palamino--a somewhat rare color among horses, a rich butter-yellow coat and plantinum blonde mane and tail.  He looked like he was once a powerful beast--bulky shoulders, strong back, long legs.  But his feet were small and agile--even at the ripe old age of 34, he could move quickly, spinning and galloping away from the truck and trailer I drove in to take him to his new home.  When he was young, he must have been gorgeous--the sort of horse that would revel in tearing across the pasture, bucking and galloping, and whom people would stop to watch in awe as he thundered by.
	
But that was not the Mingo I met.  Somewhere along the way, in an accident or illness that was long before he came to my neighbor's farm, Mingo had lost an eye.  Horse's eyes are on the sides of their head--like a bird's--so losing an eye meant losing all his vision to one side.  It seemed like it made him half a horse.  He was hardly rideable anymore, since he couldn't see where he was going to one side.  Even handling him from the ground would be problematic as he would be nervous about a person on his blind side, and more likely to kick or shy out of fear.   To a horse, seeing everything in every direction is instinctively essential--wherever you cannot see, a tiger may be lurking.  (Some horses, however, have been helped to overcome this handicap; see http://www.myhorsechat.com/category/spikers-eye-removal-equine-enucleation/ for one example.)

I used to see Mingo from his eyeless side, when I walked down the lane next to his pasture.  I could see the hairless, hollow spot where his eye had been, deceptively dark, mimicking the eye it had replaced.  If I went up to pet him from that side, even if I spoke to him as I approached, he'd startle when I touched him, jumping away and desperately craning his neck around so his other eye could see me.

His missing eye was not Mingo's only problem.  At thirty-four years old, his teeth were worn down so that he couldn't chew well, his last pasture mate had died years before, and my neighbor--his only friend left--was aging herself and, after a fall, had moved off the farm.  Mingo was now where no horse wants to be:  alone.  

That was almost a year ago.  Now my erstwhile neighbor had arranged a new home for him, near her.  So last weekend, with the warming spring suggesting the coming heat of summer, I pulled my horse trailer over to Mingo's pasture to load him up and take him to his new home.  

Mingo, I knew, had been a "pasture pony" for at least a decade.  Though he'd once been well-trained and handled, I knew he would probably have a selective memory about his training--most horses do.  So, I started with the basics--leading by hand--before trying to walk him into the trailer.  With some firm encouragement he accepted me as his boss, but I was at a loss for how to deal with his one-sided blindness.  If I walked on the side with the eye, he leaned into me, invading my space and threatening to run me over sideways.  I figured it was because he was afraid to step away from me, into the dark abyss of that side of the world that he couldn't see.  And I was unsure about leading him from the eyeless side, since he was so uncomfortable with anything he couldn't see.  At the end of our first session, we were both a little frustrated, and when I released his halter he wheeled and galloped away, glad to get away from this person who was making him face his worst fears.

The next session, though, Mingo seemed to have rethought his attitude and calmly accepted my leadership, even coming to nudge me for treats.  I felt like he wanted to be near me, like he enjoyed my attention, the interest and purpose I gave him, even for just the few minutes each day that I worked with him.  In his lonely life, I was probably the only person who had shown so much interest in him since he'd gone half-blind.  Since he was ruined.

Mingo reminded me of my friend Joanna.  Joanna is in her seventies, and confined to a wheelchair by a malady I've never heard explained.  Her teeth are gone along with her independence and, to top it all off, her husband, the father of her three children, left after the wheelchair came, saying he didn't want her anymore.  After all that there was a time, she told me, that she contemplated suicide.  What joy could she have in life now?  How could she ever be happy in a world where other people walked all around her, but she could never walk again?

God sent someone to her, she says, the very evening she was planning to kill herself, to tell her to hang on.  She'd always been faithful, but it took that evening for her to give her disability, and her despair, over to God.  After that, she started dancing.  She packed up her resentment and joined a liturgical dance group, singing spiritual songs through sign language-based hand movements.  That's how I met her, in fact, when she performed at an event I was helping with.  Dancing with her arms, her heart, and her effervescent soul, she was using every part of herself she had left to do what God had asked--and the joy of it lit up her face.  No one else I know has joy quite so contagious.

The day I finally loaded Mingo into my trailer, took him over, and walked him into his new pasture, I felt like Mingo was saying the same thing to me that my friend Joanna had said to God:  *I might not be much anymore, but what I have left, I give to you.  Lead me--I'll follow as best I can.*    

Thank you, God, that no matter how broken we are, you can still find use for the pieces.
