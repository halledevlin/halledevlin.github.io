Last weekend, I moved a horse for a friend, from my neighbor's farm to one just a few roads over. The horse was a big, older horse named Logan.  Logan looked like he was once a beautiful, powerful beast, with a long, thick neck, still-bulky shoulders and strong legs.  The sort of horse people would have stopped to watch in awe as he thundered by, galloping and bucking in the joy of his strength.

But that was not the Logan I met.  Somewhere along the way, long before he'd come to my neighbor's farm, Logan had lost an eye.  

Horse's eyes are on the sides of their head, like a bird's, so losing an eye meant losing almost all of his vision to one side.   To a horse, seeing everything in every direction is instinctively essential--wherever you cannot see, a tiger may be lurking.  It seemed to me that it made him half a horse.  He was hardly rideable anymore, since he couldn't see where he was going to one side.  Even handling him from the ground would be problematic as he would be nervous about a person on his blind side, and more likely to kick or shy out of fear.  (Some horses, however, have been helped to overcome this handicap; see http://www.myhorsechat.com/category/spikers-eye-removal-equine-enucleation/ for one example.)

I used to see Logan from his eyeless side, when I walked down the lane next to his pasture.  I could see the hairless, hollow spot where his eye had been--deceptively dark, mimicking the eye it had replaced.  If I went up to pet him from that side, even if I spoke to him as I approached, he'd startle when I touched him, jumping away and desperately craning his neck around so his other eye could see me.

His missing eye was not Logan's only problem.  At thirty-four years old, his teeth were worn down so that he couldn't chew well, his last pasture mate had died years before, and my neighbor--his only friend left--was aging herself and, after a fall, had moved off the farm.  Logan was now where no horse wants to be:  crippled, and alone.  

That was almost a year ago.  Now my erstwhile neighbor had arranged a new home for him, near her.  So last weekend, with the warming spring suggesting the coming heat of summer, I pulled my horse trailer over to Logan's pasture to load him up and take him to his new home.  

Logan, I knew, had been a "pasture pony" for at least a decade.  Despite the decided equine tendency to go feral when not handled for such a long time, with some firm encouragement Logan accepted me as boss.  But I was at a loss for how to deal with his one-sided blindness.  If I walked on the side with the eye, he leaned into me, invading my space and threatening to run me over sideways.  Was he afraid to step away from me, into the dark abyss of that side of the world that he couldn't see?  And, I was unsure about leading him from his eyeless side--how would he react to a handler he could hear and feel, but not see?  At the end of our first session, we were both a little frustrated, and when I released his halter he wheeled and galloped away, glad to get away from this person who was making him face his worst fears.

"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”  Matthew 11:28-30 (check reference and get better version)

When I returned the next day, Logan seemed to have rethought his attitude.  He calmly accepted my leadership, even coming to nudge me for treats.  I felt like he wanted to be near me, like he enjoyed my attention, the interest and purpose I gave him, even for just the few minutes each day that I worked with him.  In his lonely life, I was probably the only person who had shown so much interest in him since he'd gone half-blind.  Since he was ruined.

Logan reminded me of my friend Joanna.  Joanna is in her seventies, confined to a wheelchair by a malady I've never heard explained.  Her teeth are gone, along with her independence.  To top it all off, her husband, the father of her three children, left after the wheelchair came, saying he didn't want her anymore.  After all that there was a time, she told me, that she contemplated suicide.  What joy could she have in life now?  How could she ever be happy in a world where other people walked all around her, but she could never walk again?

"...we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."  2 Corinthians 4:7-11

God sent a friend to her, she says, the evening she was planning to kill herself, to tell her to hang on.  She'd always been faithful, but it took that evening for her to give her disability, and her despair, over to God.  After that, she started dancing.  She packed up her resentment and joined a liturgical dance group, singing spiritual songs through sign language-based hand movements, singing about the beauty and love of her Lord.  That's how I met her, in fact, when she performed at an event I was helping with.  Dancing with her arms, her heart, and her effervescent soul, she was using every part of herself she had left to do what God had asked--and the joy of it lit up her face.  No one else I know has joy quite so contagious.
(Put in here a pic of Joanna in her dance troupe?)  does the dance troupe have a pic on website or soemthing?  can I ask kay?

"...God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence. But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption—that, as it is written, 'He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.'"  1 Corinthians 1:26-31 (check ref. and version)

The day I finally loaded Logan into my trailer, took him over, and walked him into his new pasture, I felt like Logan was saying the same thing to me that my friend Joanna had said to God:  *I might not be much anymore, but what I have left, I give to you.  Lead me--I'll follow as best I can.*    

Thank you, God, that no matter how broken we are, you can still find use for the pieces.
