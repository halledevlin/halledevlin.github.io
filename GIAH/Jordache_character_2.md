Jordache:  A Purpose-Driven Horse

Today, I stayed late at work and it's pitch dark by the time I head out to feed my horses.  Feeling the path with my feet more than seeing it, I see a dim equine form ahead, picked out by the beam of the barn's night light shining through an open door.  My old chestnut friend, Jordache, is waiting for me.  

He steps out of the light as I come nearer, his aging, aching bones making his movements slow and deliberate.  A moment later, a low-throated nicker in front of my face startles me.  The broad white star on Jordache's forehead looms out of the nearby darkness and he pushes his graying head into me, eager for my company.  And, more to the point, eager for the horse feed I'm bringing.

Jordache has been every kind of horse--show horse, backyard playmate, barn clown, friend.   Over the years, he generously carried children who knew nothing about how to stay on his back, notching back his usual high-strung energy to plod at their speed.  When I got on his back, he always shifted gears to be the spirited--but--willing riding horse I wanted.   Now retired, he is still the most interesting personality in the barnyard, wreaking havoc whenever possible and always nosing up to me for a good belly rub or a treat.

With all that, you'd think he'd have a true servant's attitude.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  In his obvious opinion, he is not here to serve me.  I am here to serve him.  That's not to say he won't do what I ask; when I used to get on his back, he did what I wanted like he was reading my mind.   When I'm on the ground beside him, a word moves him, a look gets his attention.  But still he seems to believe it's all for his benefit.  Though he knows who really should be in the lead when I have a halter on him, he generally steps out first and expects me to follow.  Whenever I come around, it must be to feed (or pay attention to) *him.* 

It makes me wonder, is this how it is between God and me?  So often I, like Jordache, try to take the reins in the relationship.  *Give me the job I want.*  *I'm going this way--bless me in going there.*  And when I let Him put that halter on and I go out to do "His" work, I know that I am doing it in *my* way--taking the psychological lead and expecting God to follow.  All too often I do something--like write a letter of advice to someone who *obviously* needs it--and find my self praying as I stick it in the mailbox, "Lord, I hope this is what you wanted me to say.  'Cuz I'm sayin' it."  Am I here for God, or vice versa?  God's halter may be on, but God is getting dragged along where *I* want to go.

If God is the kind of Horseman I think he is, I wonder if he doesn't just chuckle at my willful antics.  Whenever Jordache takes those little liberties with me, I can't help but smile.  I love this horse, who has been my friend and companion for nearly every day of his long and waning life.  I can't forget all the times he's done what I asked even when it hurt.  When he trusted me and went forward even though every neuron in his prey-animal brain told him to turn and run from the tigers he thought were ahead.  When I was the first thing he came to for healing, and for Joy.

God knows that the very reasons that I love my relationship with Him are the ropes that he can yank on to put me back in line--just like my yanks on Jordache's halter remind him who should really be in the lead.  In the end, it is that comfort, that utter lack of fear and worry that I give Jordache--and that God gives me--that makes him stay after the halter comes off, to rub his sweaty head on my shoulder and enjoy every selfish moment with me he can get.
