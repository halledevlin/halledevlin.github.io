When God created Horse, he created a very special animal.  And when he gave Horse to Human, he gave us a chance to experience one of the most incredible relationships a person can have.

The only other relationship I know that compares is the relationship I have with God--except in that relationship, *I'm* the one who gets fed the grain, and has to learn to lower my head to let him put the halter on.

From either perspective, it's an awesome ride.  In this series of short "horse parables" (and upcoming book) that make up *God is a Horseman,* I invite you to join with me, my horses, and God, as we discuss living and working with each other.  Get in (or under) the saddle.
