Looking for Adventure
=====================

## Synopsis

> Julian Hager, standing magnetically clamped to the hull of a spaceship hurtling between the Moon and Earth, executing dangerous high-tech repairs against the ebony backdrop of space, feels just one thing:  bored.  Rocket engineer and pilot *par excellance*,  Julian is looking for adventure.  He finds it in a little ad in the back of a magazine, which takes him and his boss, the witty but mysterious Professor Bill Shields, rocketing towards 279 Thule:  "Farthest Asteroid From The Sun!"  Home to shovel-swinging-mad miners, conniving neighbors, and the girl of his dreams (who, of course, just wants to be friends), Thule promises to exceed Julian's expectations--and then some.
